# Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi there! I’m **[Melissa Doyle]**, and I’m passionate about discovering insights from data.  
This GitHub repository serves as the starting point for my **Data Analyst** portfolio, where I showcase my analytical skills through real-world data projects.

## About This Repository

Currently, this repo features a single project, but there's more to come!:

- **Lake Model Analysis ([`lake_model.ipynb`](lake_model.ipynb))**  
  *In this notebook, I explore and visualize water-level data for several Great Lakes over time.* 

Even with just one project, you’ll see my fundamental approach to data analytics:
1. **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** Using Python to import and preprocess CSV data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Summarizing key statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) and identifying trends.
3. **Visualization & Communication:** Leveraging Matplotlib for clear plots and annotated figures, including:
   - Scatter plots of water levels over time  
   - Boxplots comparing multiple lakes  
   - Bar charts comparing median vs. mode  
   - Lines of best fit to visualize trends  
4. **Forecasting (Basic Linear Model):** Demonstrating how I extrapolate simple time-series patterns, highlighting a naive approach to prediction.

## Highlights

- **NumPy & Matplotlib:**  
  Showcasing data manipulation and plot creation with well-structured, readable code.
- **Data Storytelling:**  
  Adding descriptive text and annotations so technical and non-technical audiences can easily interpret the visuals.
- **Attention to Detail:**  
  Careful formatting and design choices (grids, muted colors, boxstyles) to avoid clutter and maintain clarity.

## Why This Matters

- **Practical Skills:** My project demonstrates real-world tasks a data analyst faces daily—data import, cleaning, statistical insights, and visual communication.
- **Scalability:** The code follows best practices that can easily be adapted for larger datasets or more complex analyses.
- **Growth Mindset:** This notebook is just the beginning. I plan to add more projects covering diverse topics, data sources, and tools (e.g., pandas, SQL, more advanced ML models).

## Next Steps

I will continue to expand my portfolio with additional projects that involve:
- **Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering**
- **Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning**
- **Interactive Dashboards** (e.g., using Plotly or other libraries)
- **SQL queries and optimization**

Feel free to **watch** or **star** this repo to follow my progress!
